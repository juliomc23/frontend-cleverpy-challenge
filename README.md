# Cleverpy frontend challenge

This repo is a challenge that I made for Cleverpy

## Explanation of the challenge

In this challenge I had to make requests to the api of [JSON Placeholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to get the posts, modify and delete them.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
```

After the dependencies have been installed and the server is running, the first page we will see will be the login. To access the app, use these credentials.

```bash
email: admin@admin.es
password: Admin_123456
```

Once inside, go to the posts section to see the posts taken from [JSON Placeholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and interact with them.

You can also switch between English and Spanish.

Finally you can log out of the app.
